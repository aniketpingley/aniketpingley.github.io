        <h1>Polynomial Representation Using Linked List Tutorial</h1>
        <p><em>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aspingley/">Aniket Pingley, Ph.D.</a></em></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A polynomial is a mathematical expression consisting of terms with variables and constants. A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element. In this tutorial, we will explore how to represent a polynomial using a linked list in C.</p>

        <h2>Linked List Representation</h2>
        <p>In a linked list, each element is called a node. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is called the head.</p>

        <h2>Polynomial Representation</h2>
<p>A polynomial can be represented using a linked list, where each node represents a term of the polynomial. A term consists of a coefficient and an exponent. For example, the polynomial <code>3x<sup>2</sup> - 5x + 6</code> can be represented as the linked list:</p>
<pre>
        +---+    +---+    +---+
Head -> | 3 | -> | -5 | -> | 6 | -> NULL
        +---+    +---+    +---+
</pre>

<p>Another example, <code>4x<sup>3</sup> + 2x<sup>2</sup> + 7</code> would be represented as:</p>
<pre>
        +---+    +---+    +---+
Head -> | 4 | -> | 2 | -> | 7 | -> NULL
        +---+    +---+    +---+
</pre>

<p><em>Note:</em> In this representation, the nodes are arranged in decreasing order of exponents.</p>


        <h2>Implementation in C</h2>
        <p>We can implement the polynomial linked list in C using structures and dynamic memory allocation. Below is the C code:</p>
        <pre>
        <code>
        /* C code for polynomial representation using linked list */

        #include &lt;stdio.h>
        #include &lt;stdlib.h>

        // Define a node structure for the polynomial
        typedef struct PolynomialTerm {
            int coefficient;
            int exponent;
            struct PolynomialTerm* next;
        } PolynomialTerm;

        // Function to insert a new term into the polynomial
        // This function takes the head of the polynomial linked list and inserts a new term into the list while maintaining the list in sorted order based on the exponent.
        // The function returns the head of the updated list after insertion.

        PolynomialTerm* insertTerm(PolynomialTerm* polynomial, int coefficient, int exponent) {
            // Allocate memory for the new term
            PolynomialTerm* newTerm = (PolynomialTerm*) malloc(sizeof(PolynomialTerm));
            // Check if memory allocation was successful
            if (newTerm == NULL) {
                fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n"); // Print a message to the screen indicating memory allocation failed
                exit(1);
            }

            // Initialize the new term
            newTerm-&gt;coefficient = coefficient;
            newTerm-&gt;exponent = exponent;
            newTerm-&gt;next = NULL;

            // Find the correct position to insert the new term in the polynomial
            PolynomialTerm* current = polynomial;
            PolynomialTerm* previous = NULL;
            while (current != NULL && current-&gt;exponent > exponent) {
                previous = current;
                current = current-&gt;next;
            }

            // Insert the new term into the polynomial
            if (previous == NULL) {
                newTerm-&gt;next = polynomial;
                polynomial = newTerm;
            } else {
                previous-&gt;next = newTerm;
                newTerm-&gt;next = current;
            }
            
            return polynomial;
        }

        // Function to print the polynomial
        // This function takes the head of the polynomial linked list and prints the polynomial in a human-readable format.
        void printPolynomial(PolynomialTerm* polynomial) {
            PolynomialTerm* current = polynomial;
            while (current != NULL) {
                printf("%dx^%d ", current-&gt;coefficient, current-&gt;exponent);
                if (current-&gt;next != NULL &amp;&amp; current-&gt;next-&gt;coefficient >= 0) {
                    printf("+ ");
                }
                current = current-&gt;next;
            }
            printf("\n");
        }

        // Function to delete the polynomial
        // This function takes the head of the polynomial linked list and deallocates the memory used by the list.
        void deletePolynomial(PolynomialTerm* polynomial) {
            PolynomialTerm* current = polynomial;
            while (current != NULL) {
                PolynomialTerm* next = current-&gt;next;
                free(current);
                current = next;
            }
        }

        int main() {
            PolynomialTerm* polynomial = NULL;

            polynomial = insertTerm(polynomial, 3, 4);
            polynomial = insertTerm(polynomial, -5, 3);
            polynomial = insertTerm(polynomial, 2, 1);
            polynomial = insertTerm(polynomial, 6, 0);

            printPolynomial(polynomial);

            deletePolynomial(polynomial);

            return 0;
        }
        </code>
        </pre>

        <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
        <p>Below is the pseudocode for the implementation:</p>
        <pre>
        <code>
        // Function to insert a new term into the polynomial
        Function insertTerm(polynomial, coefficient, exponent) {
            // Create a new term
            newTerm = createNode(coefficient, exponent)

            // Find the correct position to insert the new term in the polynomial
            current = polynomial
            previous = NULL
            while (current != NULL and current.exponent > exponent) {
                previous = current
                current = current.next
            }

            // Insert the new term into the polynomial
            if (previous == NULL) {
                newTerm.next = polynomial
                polynomial = newTerm
            } else {
                previous.next = newTerm
                newTerm.next = current
            }
            
            return polynomial
        }

        // Function to create a new node
        Function createNode(coefficient, exponent) {
            node = new Node()
            node.coefficient = coefficient
            node.exponent = exponent
            node.next = NULL

            return node
        }
        </code>
        </pre>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
